<b> Welcome to Pradhyo's blog </b>
<br>
This is a testbed for me to learn web development. 
<br>
Choose from what I have built so far:

<form method = "post">
	<select name="project">
		<option value = "rot13">Rot13</option>
		<option value = "Soon">Coming Soon</option>
	</select>
	<input type = "submit">

</form>
